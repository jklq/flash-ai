Question,Answer
"What is the typical layout of a program's address space, from lowest to highest address?","First static data (code, global variables), then the heap, free space, and finally the stack at the highest address."
"In a process's memory, the _____ grows downwards from high addresses, while the _____ grows upwards from low addresses.",stack; heap
What is a memory leak?,"A memory issue where dynamically allocated memory is not freed after it is no longer needed, making it inaccessible."
"In C, what function is used to prevent a memory leak after allocating memory with `malloc`?",The `free()` function is used to deallocate the memory.
What is a dangling pointer?,A pointer that references a memory location that has already been freed or deallocated.
What is the purpose of the `-g` flag when compiling a C program with `gcc` for use with Valgrind?,"It includes debugging information in the compiled program, allowing Valgrind to report errors with specific line numbers."
What type of memory error does the Valgrind message `definitely lost: 40 bytes in 1 blocks` indicate?,A memory leak.
What are the three main goals of memory virtualization provided by an OS?,"Abstraction (providing a private address space), protection (isolating processes from each other), and efficiency (fast translation and optimized memory use)."
The process of converting a virtual address generated by a program into a physical address in RAM is known as _____.,address translation
"In the 'base and bound' memory management scheme, how is a physical address calculated from a virtual address?",physical address = virtual address + base
How does the 'base and bound' scheme provide memory protection?,"It checks if the virtual address is greater than or equal to the bound; if it is, an error is triggered."
"The hardware unit on the CPU responsible for address translation and protection checks, such as with base and bound, is the _____.",Memory Management Unit (MMU)
"In a simple VM where each process occupies a same-sized contiguous slot, what is the main drawback?","Internal fragmentation, where much of the memory allocated to a process is wasted because the process doesn't need it all."
What problem with the 'base and bound' approach does segmentation aim to solve?,The problem of internal fragmentation by not allocating one large contiguous chunk of memory for the entire address space.
How does segmentation work?,"It divides a process's logical address space into segments (e.g., code, heap, stack), each with its own base and bound."
"In a segmented memory system, where is the information about each segment's base and bound stored?","In a segment table, often held in hardware registers for speed."
How can the MMU determine which segment a virtual address belongs to in a segmented system?,"By using the leading bits of the virtual address to identify the segment, with the remaining bits as the offset."
"In segmentation, what additional information is needed to correctly handle the stack segment?",A bit or flag indicating the direction of growth (typically downwards).
"What memory management problem can arise from segmentation, where free memory is broken into many small, non-contiguous chunks?",External fragmentation.
What does a 'segmentation fault' error typically indicate?,"It means the program has attempted to access memory in a way that violates the rules defined in its segment table (e.g., out of bounds, wrong permissions)."
The _____ free-space allocation strategy selects the smallest available memory block that is large enough to satisfy a request.,best fit
What is the 'worst fit' free-space allocation strategy?,"It selects the largest available memory block to satisfy a request, leaving a large remainder."
What is the 'first fit' free-space allocation strategy?,It selects the first available memory block in the free list that is large enough to satisfy the request.
Why does the `malloc` library function generally avoid making a system call to the OS for every memory request?,Because system calls and context switches are very slow compared to managing memory within the process's already allocated heap.
"When a block of memory is freed, `malloc` may merge it with adjacent free blocks. What is this process called?",Coalescing.
How does `free(ptr)` know the size of the memory block to deallocate when it is only given a pointer?,The size is stored in a header block located in memory just before the pointer `ptr`.
"In memory management, what is the fundamental difference between how an OS can manage memory and how `malloc` can?","The OS can relocate segments or pages in physical memory, whereas `malloc` cannot relocate allocated blocks because it would invalidate existing pointers in the program."
"In the context of paging, what is a 'page'?","A small, fixed-size block of a process's virtual address space."
"In the context of paging, what is a 'page frame'?","A small, fixed-size block of physical memory, into which a virtual page can be mapped."
The data structure used by the OS to store the mapping between a process's virtual pages and physical page frames is called the _____.,page table
"In a paged system, how is a virtual address translated into a physical address?","The virtual address is split into a Virtual Page Number (VPN) and an offset; the VPN is used to look up the Physical Frame Number (PFN) in the page table, and the offset is added to the start of that frame."
What is the primary benefit of paging over segmentation in terms of memory fragmentation?,Paging effectively eliminates external fragmentation because any free page frame can be used for any virtual page.
"A record in a page table for a single page, containing the PFN and various status bits, is known as a _____.",Page Table Entry (PTE)
What is the function of the 'valid bit' in a Page Table Entry (PTE)?,It indicates whether the page table mapping for that page is valid or if the page has not been allocated by the process.
What is the function of the 'present bit' in a Page Table Entry (PTE)?,It indicates whether the page is currently in physical RAM or has been swapped out to disk.
What are the two main performance and memory overheads associated with simple linear page tables?,"They can consume a large amount of memory for each process, and each memory access by the program requires an additional memory access to read the page table."
What is a Translation-Lookaside Buffer (TLB)?,"A small, fast hardware cache within the MMU that stores recent translations from Virtual Page Numbers (VPNs) to Physical Frame Numbers (PFNs)."
"In the context of a TLB, what is a 'hit'?","A 'hit' occurs when the requested VPN-to-PFN translation is found in the TLB, avoiding a slower lookup in the main memory page table."
"In the context of a TLB, what is a 'miss'?","A 'miss' occurs when the requested VPN-to-PFN translation is not in the TLB, forcing a lookup in the main memory page table."
What programming principle makes TLBs highly effective at reducing memory access latency?,"Locality of reference, as programs tend to access memory locations near previously accessed locations, leading to many TLB hits."
Why must the TLB be managed during a context switch?,"Because the TLB contains address translations for the old process, which are not valid for the new process and could lead to accessing the wrong memory."
What is a simple strategy for handling the TLB on a context switch?,"To flush or clear the entire TLB, allowing it to be refilled with translations for the new process."
What problem do multi-level page tables solve?,"They solve the problem of large, linear page tables consuming excessive, contiguous memory by breaking the page table itself into smaller, page-sized chunks."
"In a two-level page table, what does the 'page directory' contain?",The page directory contains pointers to the various second-level page table pages.
Describe the address translation process in a two-level page table system.,"The VPN is split into a page directory index and a page table index; the first index finds the page table, and the second finds the PFN within that table."
What is the main trade-off of using a multi-level page table compared to a linear one?,It saves memory space but requires more memory accesses for a TLB miss (one for each level of the table).
What is a 'swap space' in an operating system?,A portion of the hard disk or SSD used to store memory pages that have been temporarily removed from physical RAM.
What triggers a 'page fault'?,"A page fault is triggered when a program tries to access a page that is marked as not 'present' in its Page Table Entry, meaning it is currently on disk."
What does the OS do in response to a page fault?,"The OS finds the page in the swap space on disk, loads it into a free frame in physical RAM, updates the page table, and then resumes the process."
The _____ page replacement policy swaps out the page that has been in memory for the longest time.,"First-In, First-Out (FIFO)"
The LRU page replacement policy swaps out which page?,The Least Recently Used (LRU) page.
Why is the optimal page replacement policy impossible to implement in a real system?,"Because it requires knowing which page will be accessed furthest in the future, which is unknowable."
For which access pattern is the LRU page replacement policy least effective?,"A looping-sequential pattern that repeatedly accesses a number of pages just larger than the available memory, causing constant page faults."
What is the 'Clock' page replacement policy?,An approximation of LRU that uses a single 'use' or 'accessed' bit per page to decide which page to swap out.
What information does the `pmap` command provide on a Unix-like system?,"It displays the memory map of a process, showing how its address space is laid out."
"Which Unix-like command can be used to monitor memory, swap, and CPU usage in real-time?","The `vmstat` command (e.g., `vmstat 1`)."
