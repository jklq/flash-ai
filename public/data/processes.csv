What is the role of the linker in the compilation process?,It adjusts addresses and connects object files to create a standalone executable.
"When linking multiple object files, what does the linker do to function calls like `call _add`?","It puts the correct, final memory address for the function into the call instruction."
Why must a program make a system call to perform actions like I/O or setting an exit code?,Because user-level programs run in a 'sandbox' and cannot directly perform these privileged actions.
"In x86-64 Linux, which register is typically used to specify the system call number?",The `%rax` register.
What is the system call number for the `exit` command in x86-64 Linux?,60.
"For the `exit` system call, which register is expected by the OS to hold the exit code?",The `%rdi` register.
What is the system call number for the `write` command in x86-64 Linux?,1.
"A _____ is a sequence of instructions, while a _____ is a running program.",program; process
What is the purpose of having two CPU modes: kernel mode and user mode?,To protect the OS and other processes by restricting the instructions a user process can execute.
"In which CPU mode will the CPU run any instruction, reserved only for the OS?",Kernel mode.
"When a process makes a system call, the CPU transitions from _____ mode to _____ mode.",user; kernel
What is the OS technique of rapidly switching between running processes to give the illusion of simultaneous execution?,Time sharing.
The OS mechanism for saving the state of one process and loading the state of another is called a _____.,context switch.
"In non-cooperative multitasking, what hardware feature allows the CPU to periodically stop a process and give control back to the OS?",An interrupt timer.
What information must the OS save during a context switch to be able to seamlessly restore a process later?,"The contents of the CPU registers (like IC, ALU flags, general-purpose registers)."
"In Linux, what does the process state 'R' signify?",Running or runnable (waiting for the CPU).
"In Linux, what does the process state 'S' signify?",Interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete).
What is the function of the `kill` command in Linux?,It sends a signal to a process with a known process ID (PID).
"Which signal asks a process to terminate nicely, allowing it to perform cleanup?",SIGTERM.
Which signal terminates a process forcefully and cannot be handled or ignored by the process?,SIGKILL.
The keyboard shortcut Ctrl+C typically sends which signal to the foreground process?,SIGINT (interrupt).
"The keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Z typically sends which signal, causing the process to stop until resumed?",SIGSTOP.
Which system call creates a new process by making an exact copy of the calling process?,`fork()`
"After a `fork()` call, what return value does the parent process receive?",The process ID (PID) of the newly created child process.
"After a `fork()` call, what return value does the child process receive?",0.
Which system call replaces the program in the current process with a new one?,`exec()`
Which system call is used by a parent process to wait for a child process to finish its execution?,`wait()`
What is a common metric for scheduling performance that measures the time from a job's arrival to its completion?,Turnaround time.
What is a scheduling metric that measures the time from a job's arrival until it first starts running?,Response time.
Which simple scheduling algorithm runs jobs in the order they arrive and is optimal for average turnaround when all jobs have the same length?,"First In, First Out (FIFO)."
"Which scheduling algorithm is optimal for average turnaround time when all jobs arrive simultaneously, by always running the shortest available job?",Shortest Job First (SJF).
"Which preemptive scheduling algorithm improves upon SJF by running the job with the least amount of time left to completion, even if a new, shorter job arrives?",Shortest Time to Completion First (STCF).
Which scheduling algorithm is designed for good response time by running each job for a short timeslice before moving to the next job in a queue?,Round Robin (RR).
What is a major drawback of the Round Robin scheduling algorithm in terms of performance?,It generally has a poor average turnaround time.
How can a scheduler improve system utilization when a process is waiting for I/O?,It can run another process on the CPU while the first one waits.
The Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) scheduler uses several _____ to model different priorities.,queues
"In MLFQ, where is a new process placed when it first arrives?",In the topmost (highest priority) queue.
"In MLFQ, what happens to a process if it uses up its entire time allotment in a queue?",It is moved down to a lower-priority queue.
What mechanism in MLFQ prevents starvation of low-priority jobs?,"A periodic priority boost, which moves all jobs to the topmost queue."
What is the main goal of the Linux Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS)?,To fairly divide CPU time among competing processes.
CFS gives the CPU to the process with the least amount of what tracked value?,Virtual runtime (`vruntime`).
"In CFS, what happens to the `vruntime` of a low-priority process compared to a high-priority one?",Its `vruntime` accumulates faster.
"In Linux, what does a higher `nice` value for a process signify?",It has a lower priority and will receive a smaller share of the CPU.
The CFS scheduler uses what type of data structure to efficiently find the process with the lowest `vruntime`?,A red-black tree.
